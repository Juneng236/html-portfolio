<h1>The best movie ranking according to June</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movie</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The notebook</h3>
<p> A beautify romcom showing love can last, love is messy but also beautiful, watched it many times and it was able to make me cry every time</p>
<h3>The vow</h3>
<p>Another romcom of course, with same actress as the notebook, another beautiful story about love<br/>
    She lost her memories but she would start loving him all over again, it is a nice and comforting watch with enough twist to keep you entertained
</p>
<h3>Glass Onion 1</h3>
<p>All I remember is the feeling of curiosity when I watch it, I should write down what my fav thing about the movie so I don't forget right after</p>
